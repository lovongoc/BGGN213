## PDB statistics
Q1: Download a CSV file from the PDB site (accessible from “Analyze” -> “PDB Statistics” > “by Experimental Method and Molecular Type”. Move this CSV file into your RStudio project and determine the percentage of structures solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy. From the website what proportion of structures are protein?

```{r}
PDBstatistics <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
percent <- PDBstatistics$Total / sum(PDBstatistics$Total)
names(percent) <- row.names(PDBstatistics)
barplot(percent)
```
